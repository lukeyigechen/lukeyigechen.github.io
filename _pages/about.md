Welcome to my website! My name is Yige (Luke) Chen. <!-- Yige is my legal name, but I also go by Luke. -->

I am a Ph.D. student in [Linguistics](http://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/index.php) at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/), supervised by Prof. [Haihua Pan](http://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/p_pan.php) ([Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages](http://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/)), co-supervised by Prof. [Keehyung Kim](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/kim-keehyung/) ([Department of Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/departments/decision-sciences-and-managerial-economics/), [CUHK Business School](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/)), and guided by Prof. [Maggie Wenjie Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-li-wenjie-maggie/) ([Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/), [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/)). My area of study is natural language processing, and my research topic is information extraction in the economic, financial and business domains. I am funded by [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funding_opport/hkpfs/) and [CUHK Vice-Chancellor HKPFS Scholarship](https://www.gs.cuhk.edu.hk/admissions/scholarships-fees/hkpfs). 

I received an M.S. in [Computational Linguistics](https://www.compling.uw.edu/) from the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu/), [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) (advised by Prof. [Fei Xia](https://linguistics.washington.edu/people/fei-xia)), an M.Phil. in [Theoretical and Applied Linguistics](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/dtal) from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) (supervised by Prof. [Nigel Collier](https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/)), and a B.S. in [Economics](https://econ.wisc.edu/), [Linguistics](https://langsci.wisc.edu/), [Mathematics](http://www.math.wisc.edu/), and [Asian Studies](https://eastasia.wisc.edu/) with a Certificate in [Computer Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Prior to that, I spent 2 years studying at the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) as an undergraduate student. 

I explore the boundary between economics and linguistics using computational and quantitative approaches, with a specific focus on the Koreanic, Sinitic, Japonic, and Anglic languages. My primary research interests include natural language processing, computational linguistics, information systems, information extraction<!-- (esp. in the domains of economics, finance, and business)-->, machine learning, corpus linguistics, machine translation, and economics of language. Apart from the above, I'm also interested in behavioral economics, econometrics, phonology, syntax, formal semantics, <!--historical linguistics, -->and second language acquisition<!--, and East Asian languages (Korean, Chinese Dialects, Classical Chinese, and Japanese)-->. 

I was a research assistant for Prof. [Yi Yang](https://yya518.github.io/) in the [Department of Information Systems, Business Statistics and Operations Management](http://www.bm.ust.hk/isom/), [School of Business and Management](https://www.bm.ust.hk/), at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), a research assistant for Prof. [Jungyeul Park](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/profile/jungyeul-park), and was a lab assistant at the [Second Language Acquisition Lab (SLA Lab)](https://dept.english.wisc.edu/slalab/), UW-Madison for Prof. [Jacee Cho](https://english.wisc.edu/staff/cho-jacee/).
