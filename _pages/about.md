Welcome to my website! My name is Yige (Luke) Chen. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Linguistics](https://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/) at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/), supervised by Prof. [Haihua Pan](https://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty-linguistics/pan-haihua/) ([Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages](https://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/)), and guided by Prof. [Keehyung Kim](https://www.ou.edu/price/bios/keehyung-kim) ([Price College of Business](https://www.ou.edu/price), [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/)) and Prof. [Maggie Wenjie Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-li-wenjie-maggie/) ([Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/), [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/)). My areas of study are natural language processing and computational linguistics. I am funded by [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funding_opport/hkpfs/) and [CUHK Vice-Chancellor HKPFS Scholarship](https://www.gs.cuhk.edu.hk/admissions/scholarships-fees/hkpfs). 

I explore the boundary between economics and linguistics using computational and quantitative approaches, with a specific focus on Korean, Chinese languages, Japanese, and English. My research interests lie primarily in the following areas: 

* Information extraction in the economic, financial and business domains
* Incorporating linguistic knowledge into language models and NLP tasks
* The effects of languages and NLP techniques on economic decision-making

I received an M.S. in [Computational Linguistics](https://www.compling.uw.edu/) from the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu/), [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) (advised by Prof. [Fei Xia](https://linguistics.washington.edu/people/fei-xia)), an M.Phil. in [Theoretical and Applied Linguistics](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/dtal) from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) (supervised by Prof. [Nigel Collier](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/nhc30)), and a B.S. in [Economics](https://econ.wisc.edu/), [Linguistics](https://langsci.wisc.edu/), [Mathematics](https://math.wisc.edu/), and [Asian Studies](https://eastasia.wisc.edu/) with a Certificate in [Computer Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Prior to that, I spent 2 years studying [Hospitality Management](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/tourism/) and [Industrial Design](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/design/) at the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) as an undergraduate student. 

I was a research assistant for Prof. [Yi Yang](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/imyiyang) in the [Department of Information Systems, Business Statistics and Operations Management](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/), [School of Business and Management](https://bm.hkust.edu.hk/), at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), a research assistant for Prof. [Jungyeul Park](https://languagesciences.ubc.ca/people/faculty/jungyeul-park), and was a lab assistant at the [Second Language Acquisition Lab (SLA Lab)](https://dept.english.wisc.edu/slalab/), [Department of English](https://english.wisc.edu/), [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) for Prof. [Jacee Cho](https://english.wisc.edu/staff/cho-jacee/). I am also affiliated with the [Language Processing Laboratory](https://cuhklpl.github.io/), [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/) led by Prof. [Zhenguang G. Cai](https://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty-linguistics/cai-zhenguang/). 

I was a visiting student at [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/) (through the Cross-Institutional Course Enrolment Scheme), the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), and the [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/).

I was born and raised in Ningbo, China, and am a native speaker of Wu Chinese. I also speak English, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean. My secondary education was completed at [Zhenhai High School](http://zhzx.net.cn/).
