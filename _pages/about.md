Welcome to my website! My name is Yige (Luke) Chen. 

I am a Ph.D. student in [Linguistics] at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong], supervised by Prof. [Haihua Pan] ([Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages]), and co-supervised by Prof. [Wenjie Li] ([Department of Computing], [Hong Kong Polytechnic University]) and Prof. [Keehyung Kim] ([Department of Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics], [CUHK Business School]). My area of study is natural language processing, and my research topic is information extraction in the economic, financial and business domains. I am funded by [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme] and [CUHK Vice-Chancellorâ€™s PhD Scholarship Scheme]. 

I received an M.S. in [Computational Linguistics] from the [Department of Linguistics], [University of Washington] (advised by Prof. [Fei Xia]), an M.Phil. in [Theoretical and Applied Linguistics] from the [University of Cambridge] (supervised by Prof. [Nigel Collier]), and a B.S. in [Economics], [Linguistics], [Mathematics], and [Asian Studies] with a Certificate in [Computer Sciences] from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison]. Prior to that, I spent 2 years studying at the [South China University of Technology] as an undergraduate student. 

I explore the boundary between economics and linguistics using computational and quantitative approaches, with a specific focus on the Koreanic, Sinitic, and Japonic languages. My primary research interests include computational linguistics, natural language processing, information systems, information extraction (esp. in the domains of economics, finance, and business), machine learning, corpus linguistics, and economics of language. Apart from the above, I'm also interested in behavioral economics, econometrics, phonology, syntax, historical linguistics, second language acquisition, and East Asian languages (Korean, Chinese Dialects, Classical Chinese, and Japanese). 

I was a research assistant for Prof. [Yi Yang] in the [Department of Information Systems, Business Statistics and Operations Management], [School of Business and Management], at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology], a research assistant for Prof. [Jungyeul Park], and was a lab assistant at the [Second Language Acquisition Lab (SLA Lab)], UW-Madison with Prof. [Jacee Cho].
