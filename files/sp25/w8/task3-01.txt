Mom, you know how Hong Kongâ€™s sky sometimes looks so bright and blue? Thatâ€™s because of how sunlight plays with the air!  

Imagine sunlight is like a big bowl of rainbow-colored candies. The light from the sun has all the colorsâ€”red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. But when sunlight enters the sky, it bumps into tiny air particles, like dust and gas. Some colors, like red and yellow, pass through more easily, but blue is like a little featherâ€”it gets scattered in all directions!  

So, when we look up, we see the scattered blue light everywhere, making the whole sky look blue. Itâ€™s like the sky is sprinkling blue dust all around!  

And thatâ€™s why, on a clear day in Hong Kong, the sky looks so beautifully blue. But when the sun sets, the light has to travel even farther, so we see more of the reds and oranges instead. Cool, right? ðŸ˜Š
