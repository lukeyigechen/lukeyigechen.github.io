Ugh, traffic is unbearable today! I swear, Pigland's roads are getting worse every year. Look at this—I've been stuck behind this snail-paced carrot truck for half an hour. How am I supposed to make it to the office on time?

The boss is already on my back about last quarter’s performance. The market’s been a mess—interest rates are up, global inflation is still biting, and AI stocks are swinging wildly. And now, PigAI is making headlines every day with its latest NLP model. Everyone thinks AI is the future, but honestly, I just need it to predict whether I’ll ever get a raise.

I bet when I walk in, the senior partners will be huddled around the monitor, watching the latest Fed announcement like it’s the World Cup. If Powell sneezes, the whole market tanks. And me? I’m just a pig trying to survive in a hedge fund, dodging layoffs and pretending I understand all these macroeconomic trends.

Ugh, finally! The traffic’s moving. If I can just make it upstairs before the morning meeting starts, maybe—oh no. My coffee just spilled all over my tie. Fantastic. Just another day in the life of a pig in finance.
