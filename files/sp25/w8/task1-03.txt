Royal Address by His Majesty, the Pig King of Pigland on the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics

My beloved citizens of Pigland,

Today, I stand before you filled with pride and anticipation as we look toward the grand event that unites the world in the spirit of competition, excellence, and camaraderie—the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

For centuries, we pigs have demonstrated not only strength and agility but also wisdom and resilience. This year, as our finest athletes prepare to represent the Kingdom of Pigland on the world stage, let it be known: we do not merely compete; we inspire. From the swiftest sprinters to the most graceful gymnasts, our delegation shall embody the very essence of our nation's unyielding spirit.

Yet, these Olympics arrive at a time of global uncertainty. Nations grapple with economic turbulence, technological disruption, and the ever-changing tides of international affairs. It is in such moments that the Games serve as a beacon of unity—a reminder that despite our differences, we are bound by a shared pursuit of greatness.

To our athletes, I say: Train with diligence, compete with honor, and carry the banner of Pigland high. To our people, I declare: Let us support them with unwavering pride, for their victories shall be our victories, and their struggles shall strengthen our resolve.

As we send forth our champions, let them stand as ambassadors of our kingdom’s enduring legacy. The world shall know that Pigland does not merely participate in history—we make it.

May the spirit of the Olympics burn brightly in our hearts.

Glory to Pigland!
