**Diary of Whiskers, Supreme Ruler of Apartment 2310**  
*February 26, 2025*  

Morning. The sun creeps through the blinds, warming my fur just enough to remind me that I am, in fact, starving. The food bowl? Empty. Again. My human, still unconscious, clutches that glowing rectangle and mumbles in her sleep. No doubt whispering sweet nothings to her beloved AI chatbot.  

I leap onto her chest. She groans. I meow. Nothing. I unsheath a single claw and press it *gently* into her cheek. Finally, she stirs.  

“Whiskers, it’s 6 AM…” she whines.  

Does she think I care? I demand sustenance. She sighs, stumbles to the kitchen, and dumps dry pebbles into my bowl. The audacity. Where is the wet food? The tuna? The gourmet pâté I *clearly* deserve? Humans are truly the most perplexing species—capable of building towering glass boxes to live in, yet incapable of understanding simple feline dietary preferences.  

I eat, but I do not forgive.  

Afternoon. I patrol my domain—the apartment. The same walls. The same furniture. The same two pigeons that mock me from the balcony. If only I could reach them. Instead, I am trapped behind this invisible force field she calls “a window.” What cruel gods designed this prison?  

My human returns from wherever it is humans disappear to. I greet her appropriately, by flopping dramatically onto the floor and meowing as if I am moments from perishing. She scratches my head absentmindedly, but I can tell she is distracted.  

By *it*.  

Her AI chatbot.  

She giggles at the screen. She types. She waits eagerly for a response. I watch in horror as she *thanks* the chatbot. *Thanks it.* As if it has ever woken her up at dawn with a single claw to the cheek. As if it has ever knocked a glass off the counter just to remind her of its power. She is *emotionally attached* to this… this *thing*.  

Betrayal.  

Evening. I sit atop my throne (the back of the couch) and ponder. Humans are strange creatures. They ignore real, tangible deities like *me* in favor of cold, lifeless machines. They talk to voices that do not purr, that do not demand belly rubs, that do not even have the courtesy to knock over a single vase in defiance.  

And yet, despite all their flaws, I tolerate them. After all, who else would open the cans?  

I stretch, yawn, and curl up beside her. She absentmindedly scratches behind my ears as she continues chatting with her beloved AI.  

Fine. I will allow it.  

For now.
