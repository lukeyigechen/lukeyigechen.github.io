**Interview with a Local Duckland Duck on the Great Slop-Quack Standoff**

*Interviewer:* We're here today at the border of Duckland and Pigland to catch up with Mr. Quacker McFlap, a local duck whose daily life has been upended by the infamous flooding of our Diplomatic Pond. Thanks for joining us, Mr. McFlap. How are you holding up?

*Mr. McFlap:* Honestly, not so great. This isn’t my usual waddle—I've been splashed, bogged down, and generally inconvenienced by all this slop from Pigland. I used to glide on a pristine pond every morning, and now I’m battling mud and ripples like a fish out of water. It’s exhausting!

*Interviewer:* That does sound rough. Can you describe how this event has changed your daily routine?

*Mr. McFlap:* Oh, absolutely. Before this, my mornings were all about a nice, clean splash, maybe some serene preening. Now, every morning I’m dodging clumps of mud, trying to keep my feathers intact, and I often end up landing in a puddle that tastes more like pig feed than duck nourishment. It's a constant reminder that the border isn't as peaceful as it used to be!

*Interviewer:* And what about President Drake’s response to all of this? We know he’s been making some very, shall we say, bold statements.

*Mr. McFlap:* Don’t get me started on President Drake. That pompous quack struts around like he’s saving the day with his empty slogans, but all he’s doing is stirring up a bigger frenzy. I’ve heard his speeches—“Making our pond great again!” and all that jazz—but I’d rather have a quiet waddle than listen to him toss around buzzwords. His bombastic attitude doesn’t fix muddy water!

*Interviewer:* It sounds like you're quite fed up with the leadership. Is there any local sentiment for an immediate solution?

*Mr. McFlap:* Well, in our little flock, we’re all tired of the chaos. We’re calling for some real action—maybe a proper cleanup of our Diplomatic Pond, an honest fix of Pigland’s so-called “innovative” dam project, and definitely someone who understands our needs rather than someone who just loves to quack on stage. I mean, we ducks work hard to maintain our home; we deserve respect, not a daily mud bath courtesy of a pig’s engineering mishap.

*Interviewer:* What do you think lies ahead for the border now that tensions are high?

*Mr. McFlap:* I’m not expecting any quick fixes. Right now, it feels like the standoff is just another tussle between Pigland’s royal oinks and Duckland’s loud quacks. I personally plan to take care of my belly and my feathers, maybe join a grassroots meeting, though I'm skeptical things will change without more sensible leadership. It's a messy time, literally and figuratively!

*Interviewer:* Thanks for sharing your experience, Mr. McFlap. Your honest perspective really shines a light on how this event is impacting everyday ducks, not just the political stage.

*Mr. McFlap:* Thank you. I might just be one humble duck, but I believe if enough of us start to quack, eventually someone will listen. Until then, I'll keep doing my best to waddle through the mud!
