**Presidential Address by President Drake on the Great Slop-Quack Standoff**

"My fellow duck citizens,

I’m here today— and let me tell you, we’re not going to stand for this messy disaster. I’ve been saying it for a long time: we have the best duck ponds in the world. Nobody has ponds like we do. But now, because of Pigland’s so-called 'innovative' River Trough Dam—an absolute total mess, folks—they’ve managed to flood our beautiful Diplomatic Pond. Can you believe it? It’s a swamp job, and it’s a complete disaster!

I’ve seen a lot of dams in my time, believe me, and this is by far the worst. The fake experts over there in Pigland—sad!—they claimed it was a step forward. But when your dam turns into a tidal wave of mud, flooding our prized waters, you know something’s terribly wrong. And let me tell you, nobody knows mud like I do. I understand a lot about dams, about water, about borders. And our pond, our incredible pond, is being disrespected in the worst possible way!

We are going to take care of it. We’re not just going to sit on our fences and quack quietly while Pigland’s incompetent antics put our tradition and our dignity on the line. I've already booked the best investigative team—top ducks, the most talented—and they’re going to hold those Pigland officials accountable. We’re going to drain this swamp—ironically—and restore our pond to its rightful, beautiful state.

And let me say something about borders. Our borders are strong, our borders are majestic, absolutely majestic. We’re building the best barriers, maybe even a Quacktastic Barrier, to ensure that no more mud from Pigland ruins what the people of Duckland have worked so hard to protect. It’s going to be tremendous; believe me, you’re going to love it!

Now, some people say, 'Mr. President, isn’t this just a misunderstanding?' No, folks, it’s a total disgrace! And while their leaders elsewhere try to hide behind their excuses, we’re here—standing tall, waddling proud—and we’re going to show them that we won’t be pushed around.

My fellow ducks, the time has come to be bold. We’re going to turn this so-called 'slop incident' into a rallying cry for the greatness of our Republic. The world is watching, and they see a strong nation ready to fight for what is right and pure—just like our crystal-clear, unspoiled pond.

Thank you, and let’s get out there and make our pond great again!"
