### Assessment scheme
* Presentation (20%): Starting from the third tutorial, a group of 3-4 students will conduct a 15-min joint presentation of a research paper (provided by the instructor) on SLA to the class, prepare 2 discussion questions and lead the discussion in each of the tutorials. 
* Quiz (30%): A close-book written quiz will be administered in class to help consolidate students’ understanding of important concepts of SLA and L2 data analysis.
* Term project (50%): Students will design an empirical research project investigating an issue in L2 acquisition individually.
  * Abstract (10%): max. 350 words, excl. references
  * Proposal (40%): max. 3,000 words, excl. references and appendices
* Attendance at lectures and tutorials is required. 5% will be deducted from the final score in cases where students miss three or more lectures/tutorials without a legitimate reason.
